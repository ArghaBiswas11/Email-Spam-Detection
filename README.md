Our models efficiently detects spam emails achieving great accuracies. We are using models such as, Guassian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, XGBoost Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression giving accuracies, <em>96%</em>, <em>95%</em>, <em>98%</em>, <em>93%</em>, <em>97%</em>, and <em>97%</em> respectively. XGBoost outperforms all the other models and produces the best results with the best acuuracy.</p>
